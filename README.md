### [Project 1 : Webscrapping: webscrapping using Pandas](https://github.com/artishk/jubilant-octo-funicular/blob/master/webscrappingusingpandas%20(1).ipynb)
- Project  shows  how to easily web scrape data from websites in Python using the pandas library. 
- Particularly, the read_html() function or practically pd.read_html() will be used to extract table data of  Department of Investment and Public Asset Management from        **https://dipam.gov.in/en/disinvestments/.** 
- This data consists of various financial disvestment of Central public sector enterprises done by Government of India each financial year. 
- Then did some cleanup to produce the final data in the form of a dataframe. 
- Finally, I did a quick exploratory data analysis by making histogram plots.


### [Project 2 : webapp on webscrapping using streamlit and deploying the app on streamlitsharing.io](https://share.streamlit.io/artishk/streamlit/main/webapp_on_scrapping.py)
- This app performs the simple web scrapping of NFL FOOTBALL  player Stats data (focusing on Rushing)!
* **Python libraries:** base64,pandas, streamlit, numpy,matplotlib, seaborn.
* **Data Source:** [pro-football-reference.com](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/)

### [Project 3 : Analysing personal Netflix data](https://github.com/artishk/jubilant-octo-funicular/blob/master/Analysing%20Personal%20Netflix%20Data.ipynb)
