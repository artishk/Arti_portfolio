### [Project 1 : Webscrapping: webscrapping using Pandas](https://github.com/artishk/jubilant-octo-funicular/blob/master/webscrappingusingpandas%20(1).ipynb)
- Project  shows  how to easily web scrape data from websites in Python using the pandas library. 
- Particularly, the read_html() function or practically pd.read_html() will be used to extract table data of  Department of Investment and Public Asset Management from        **https://dipam.gov.in/en/disinvestments/.** 
- This data consists of various financial disvestment of Central public sector enterprises done by Government of India each financial year. 
- Then did some cleanup to produce the final data in the form of a dataframe. 
- Finally, I did a quick exploratory data analysis by making histogram plots.
